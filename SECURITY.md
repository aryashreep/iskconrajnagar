If you discover any security vulnerability related to this site (e.g., issues with HTML forms, file uploads, external links, etc.), we humbly request that you:

1. **Do not disclose it publicly.**
2. **Email us privately** at `security@shreemandir.org` with clear details and reproduction steps (if possible).
3. Allow us time to investigate and address the issue before any public disclosure.

This policy applies to:

- HTML/CSS content and structure
- Any scripts used (if added later)

## Our Commitment

We will:

- Acknowledge your report within 3–5 business days.
- Investigate and fix legitimate issues promptly.
